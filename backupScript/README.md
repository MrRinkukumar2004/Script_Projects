# Daily Backup Script

This project involves creating a simple script to back up a specified directory at 6 PM every day using a cron job.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux)
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting and cron jobs
- Access to the terminal with appropriate permissions

## Setup

### Step 1: Create the Script File

Create a new script file called `backupScript.sh`:

```bash
rinku@asus:~/data1/Devops/Script/backupScript$ touch backupScript.sh
```

### Step 2: Edit the Script File

Open the script file in a text editor (e.g., vim) and add the backup script code:

```bash
rinku@asus:~/data1/Devops/Script/backupScript$ vim backupScript.sh
```

Add the following content to `backupScript.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

SOURCE="/home/rinku/data1/Devops/Github"
DESTINATION="/home/rinku/data2"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H_%M-%S)

# Create backup directory and copy files
mkdir -p $DESTINATION/$DATE
cp -rv $SOURCE $DESTINATION/$DATE

echo "$DATE Backup completed on"
```

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable

Make the script executable by running the following command:

```bash
rinku@asus:~/data1/Devops/Script/backupScript$ sudo chmod +x backupScript.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the Script Manually (for testing)

You can test the script by running it manually:

```bash
rinku@asus:~/data1/Devops/Script/backupScript$ bash backupScript.sh
```

## Automate the Script with Cron

To automate the backup process to run at 6 PM every day, set up a cron job:

### Step 1: Edit the Crontab File

Open the crontab file for editing:

```bash
rinku@asus:~$ crontab -e
```

### Step 2: Add the Cron Job

Add the following line to schedule the script to run every day at 6 PM:

```bash
0 18 * * * /home/rinku/data1/Devops/Script/backupScript/backupScript.sh
```

Save and close the crontab file.

## Notes

- Ensure that the destination directory has sufficient space for backups.
- Check the logs or output messages for any errors during the backup process.
- Adjust the source and destination paths as needed based on your directory structure.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
    - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script and write to the destination directory.
    - Use `sudo` if required.

2. **Incorrect Path**
    - Double-check the source and destination paths in the script.
    - Ensure the paths are absolute and correctly specified.

3. **Cron Job Not Running**
    - Verify the cron job is scheduled correctly by listing the cron jobs with `crontab -l`.
    - Check the cron service is running: `sudo service cron status`.
    - Look for cron job logs in `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/cron.log`.

## Example Output

When the script runs successfully, you will see output similar to the following:

```bash
'/home/rinku/data1/Devops/Github' -> '/home/rinku/data2/2024-07-16_21_40-00/Github'
'/home/rinku/data1/Devops/Github/Git 1-20240506_081457-Meeting Recording.mp4' -> '/home/rinku/data2/2024-07-16_21_40-00/Github/Git 1-20240506_081457-Meeting Recording.mp4'
'/home/rinku/data1/Devops/Github/Git 2-20240507_081524-Meeting Recording.mp4' -> '/home/rinku/data2/2024-07-16_21_40-00/Github/Git 2-20240507_081524-Meeting Recording.mp4'
2024-07-16_21_40-00 Backup completed on
```
